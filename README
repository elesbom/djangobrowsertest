djangobrowsertest is a way to test your application through a browser that doesn't leave
attached to an testing tool. You can test with selenium, twill,
zc.testbrowser etc. Most of the code here is borrowed with some minimum changes from:
http://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/2879#comment:41

Usage:

Just make this import:

>>> from djangobrowsertest.browsertest import BrowserTestCase

and make your class inherit from it:

>>> class MyTest(BrowserTestCase):
... def setUp(self):
...     super(MyTest, self).setUp() #starts the live server and all related stuff
...
... def tearDown(self):
...     super(MyTest, self).tearDown() #kills the server thread and drops the database

and voil√°!
